## Markov Chain Monte Carlo for the Canonical Ensemble

Semi-interactive code for simulations in the *NVT* ensemble according to the Metropolis' acceptance/rejection criteria derived from the detailed balance condition of the ergodic markov chain proposed.

The environment consists of a fixed-size simulation box centered in the origin, filled with spherical molecules based on the density of the system. Their interaction is according to either a Lennard-Jones or Square-Well potential (implementation of additional potentials is straightforward) in the reduced unit's system.

New states are generated by random displacements of the molecules position,

where the state $\nu$ is generated from state $\mu$ by displacing a molecule $i$ from $\vec{r}_i^\mu$ to $\vec{r}_i^\nu$. To ensure microscopic reversibility, the Metropolis method considers the probabilities of attempting the forward and reverse moves as equal.

Acceptance of this new state is subject to the probability:

The algorithm is summarized in five simple steps:

Code has been designed with succesful parameters as compared with official reported results. This includes a 20σ ✕ 20σ ✕ 20σ simulation box with 2 ✕ N ✕ 10E4 relaxation steps and 2.5 ✕ N ✕ 10E5 equilibrium steps, for a total of 25,000 samples.

A simple and semi-interactive execution has been designed for those not familiar with the Julia language, where the density and temperature are taken as parameters, i. e., a system with ρ* = 0.1 and T* = 1.5:

    julia Canonical.jl 0.1 1.5

This generates output files with the energy, chemical potential and radial distribution function evolution of the system along the simulation, as well as their corresponding plots.
